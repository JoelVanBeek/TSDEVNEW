## Why?

1. JavaScript has issues
    * Broken `this` pointer
    * `"use strict";` - strict mode
    * Missing important features
        * Splitting scopes, interfaces, classes
        * Some of which might come in the future

---

## Why?

2. JavaScript is too dynamic for the most usecases
    * Large code bases make people scared!
        * Refactoring is often find-replace, very brittle
        * IDE support is limited

## TypeScript as a solution

TypeScript introduces optional static typing to JavaScript

* Refactoring becomes easier
* Good IDE support
* At worst, it provides good static code analysis

* Lead architect of C#
    * Introduced **dynamic** to C#
* Developer on TypeScript.
    * Introduced **types** to JavaScript.

## Release cycle

TypeScript releases a minor version about every 2 months

* See [https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap) <!-- .element target="_blank" -->
* A minor version always contains actual new language features
* A minor version can contain "breaking changes"
    * I.e. a new type check can catch more bugs in your code
* We try to keep our material as up-to-date as possible
